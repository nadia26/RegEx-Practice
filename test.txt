This is a test file for our regular expression Software Development project. Since Software Development is the name of a course at Stuyvesant High School, it is capitalized and may be picked up by the namefinder even though it isn't the name of a person. We will first use regular expressions to find all of the words that are possibly people’s names. This will pick up places, like San Francisco, which will later need to be weeded out. To do this, we will use a census database to compare the “candidates” to known first and last names. Names such as John-Michael McCann and Carol-Lynn Mills may cause our program trouble due to the hyphens and camelcase. On the other hand, super common names like John Smith and Sophia Brown should work.
